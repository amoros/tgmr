Task manager (bash) script for GNU/Linux. That takes as input file, reads it line by line, and displays the content of the input file in the desktop notification area. Strongly recomended to be run from a cronjob. Might help someone organise his/her life. 

So here is how I apply it: 

- Cronjob every 30 minutes
- Shortcut to terminal
- Alias for editing the tasks.log file
- Automatic sync. of tasks.log file via Dropbox

Adding a does not take more than 15 sec. and it is automatically synced.

# Future enhancement

- Android app. w. desktop notifications
- Keywords support
- Fancier desktop notifications
